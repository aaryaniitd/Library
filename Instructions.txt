These are the instructions for running the MyLibrary program:

1. In order to choose any of the available options, you must press the number associated with
that option. eg. If "Lend Book" option is at number 3, then press 3 in order to initiate lending process.

2. After you complete an option process then you might see the options again by writing "yes"
or you may quit the program by writing "no".

3. Everytime you choose an option and then do what the option offers, you will be asked
whether to see the options again or not, and you can do the desired by following the above
instruction.

This Program can also be used by you to maintain your personal library records.
The Books.txt file holds all the books your library has, and is permanently altered each time you 
run the program.
Helper program is not for your use, it is just to make the main program run. Altering Helper program
may lead to failure in running Library program.
